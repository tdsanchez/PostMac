## Common Tasks

### Check if monitoring is working
```bash
# Check daemon status
sudo launchctl list | grep apfs-monitor

# View recent logs
tail -20 /var/log/apfs-monitor.log

# Watch logs in real-time
tail -f /var/log/apfs-monitor.log
```

### Update monitoring thresholds
```bash
# Edit thresholds
sudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.local.apfs-monitor.plist

# Restart daemon
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.local.apfs-monitor.plist
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.local.apfs-monitor.plist
```

### Emergency space cleanup
```bash
# Delete Time Machine local snapshots (safe, already backed up)
tmutil deletelocalsnapshots /

# Clear system caches (safe, regeneratable)
sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/*
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/*

# Empty trash
rm -rf ~/.Trash/*
```

### Update monitor after code changes
```bash
cd apfs-monitor
sudo bash update-daemon.sh
```

## What This Solves

**Problem**: APFS containers share space across volumes. When one fills, Time Machine snapshots fail, system becomes unstable. This happened ~10 times over 6 years, costing ~3 hours each.

**Solution**: Automated monitoring alerts you before space becomes critical, preventing 3-hour recovery sessions.

**Result**: Computer manages APFS complexity automatically. No more manual vigilance required.

---

## Current Alert Thresholds

- **Warning**: 30 GB free (you have time to clean up)
- **Critical**: 20 GB free (immediate action needed)

**Your boot container (disk3)**: Currently at 31.54 GB free - close to warning threshold.

**Recommendation**: After freeing space, increase thresholds to 40-50 GB warning / 25-30 GB critical.

## Need Help?

1. Check **SUMMARY.md** for quick commands
2. See **MASTER-DOCUMENTATION.md** for complete troubleshooting guide
3. Review **README.md** for tool-specific documentation
4. Check logs: `tail -f /var/log/apfs-monitor.log`

**The monitoring solution is now active and protecting your system.**
